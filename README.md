# Cosmo Kids Watch — Home Assistant integration

Unofficial Home Assistant integration for the [COSMO JrTrack](https://cosmotogether.com/)
kids smartwatch. COSMO is a white-label of the **FiLIP** platform, so this talks
to the same backend the official COSMO app uses (`api.myfilip.com`).

## What you get

A device per watch, with:

| Entity | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Location | `device_tracker` | Last-known GPS on the HA map; accuracy from the fix radius. Fix time, phone number, emergency flag as attributes. |
| Request location | `button` | **On-demand live fix** — enables "active tracking" so the watch reports every ~10 s for a few minutes. The only action that wakes the watch. |
| Battery | `sensor` | Watch battery %. |
| Charger battery | `sensor` | Charging cradle/base battery % (diagnostic). |
| Last location fix | `sensor` | Timestamp of the most recent GPS fix. |
| Firmware | `sensor` | Firmware version (diagnostic, disabled by default). |
| SOS / emergency | `binary_sensor` | Watch is in emergency mode. |
| Powered off | `binary_sensor` | Watch has been shut down. |

### Location history
Home Assistant's recorder logs every location update, giving you a **history
trail / timeline the COSMO app itself doesn't offer**. Add a Map card with a
history path to see where the watch has been.

## Design: the watch is never polled on a schedule

The scheduled poll only reads `/v2/map` — COSMO's **server cache** (last-known
location/battery) — which never contacts the watch. The watch is woken only when
you press **Request location** (or call the service), so you decide when to spend
its battery on a live fix.

## Installation (HACS)

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/kunalkhosla/cosmo-homeassistant`, category **Integration**.
2. Install **Cosmo Kids Watch**, then restart Home Assistant.
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Cosmo Kids Watch**.
4. Enter your COSMO parent-account **email and password**.
5. Pick the watch. Done.

## How auth works

Email + password → `POST /v2/token` → short-lived access token + refresh token.
The integration renews the access token via `/v2/token/refresh` and falls back to
a full re-login with the stored password if the refresh chain ever breaks — so it
keeps working across restarts without re-prompting.
